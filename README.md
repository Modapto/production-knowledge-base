Run with Docker and Docker Compose.

It gives you the ability to analyze any data set by using the searching/aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch and
the visualization power of Kibana.

Based on the [official Docker images][elastic-docker] from Elastic:

* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/main/distribution/docker)
* [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/tree/main/docker)
* [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana/tree/main/src/dev/build/tasks/os_packages/docker_generator)

Other available stack variants:

* [`tls`](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk/tree/tls): TLS encryption enabled in Elasticsearch, Kibana (opt in),
  and Fleet
* [`searchguard`](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk/tree/searchguard): Search Guard support

## tl;dr

```sh
docker-compose --profile=setup up setup
```

```sh
docker-compose up
```
---

## Requirements

### Host setup

* [Docker Engine][docker-install] version **18.06.0** or newer
* [Docker Compose][compose-install] version **1.28.0** or newer (including [Compose V2][compose-v2])
* 1.5 GB of RAM

> [!NOTE]
> Especially on Linux, make sure your user has the [required permissions][linux-postinstall] to interact with the Docker
> daemon.

By default, the stack exposes the following ports:

* 5044: Logstash Beats input
* 50000: Logstash TCP input
* 9600: Logstash monitoring API
* 9200: Elasticsearch HTTP
* 9300: Elasticsearch TCP transport
* 5601: Kibana

> [!WARNING]
> Elasticsearch's [bootstrap checks][bootstrap-checks] were purposely disabled to facilitate the setup of the Elastic
> stack in development environments. For production setups, we recommend users to set up their host according to the
> instructions from the Elasticsearch documentation: [Important System Configuration][es-sys-config].

### Docker Desktop

#### Windows

If you are using the legacy Hyper-V mode of _Docker Desktop for Windows_, ensure [File Sharing][win-filesharing] is
enabled for the `C:` drive.

#### macOS

The default configuration of _Docker Desktop for Mac_ allows mounting files from `/Users/`, `/Volume/`, `/private/`,
`/tmp` and `/var/folders` exclusively. Make sure the repository is cloned in one of those locations or follow the
instructions from the [documentation][mac-filesharing] to add more locations.

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> You must rebuild the stack images with `docker-compose build` whenever you switch branch or update the
> [version](#version-selection) of an already existing stack.

Give Kibana about a minute to initialize, then access the Kibana web UI by opening <http://localhost:5601> in a web
browser and use the following (default) credentials to log in:

* user: elastic
* password: -AwgIfDWbt_Mb+Z=_+Ck
